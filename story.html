        <h1>HERE'S THE STORY</h1>
        <p>HAZY DAYS follows a man named Deen Harborache and his slow descent into something horrific. He and his sister Marina were the sole victims of a serial killer known as the Hazy Days Killer- an unknown supernatural being that killed by possessing a person and using them as a vehicle to destroy families from the inside out through violent cannibalism. Deen and Marina's mothers Christina and Aguilera had been found dead in a murder-suicide, with both children as the sole witnesses of the event.</p>
        <p>It's been two decades since then, and Deen is now 30 years old, working as a security guard at a local high school. His husband Neil and adoptive sister Melly are simply witnesses to the growing corruption that comes, because the Hazy Days Killer has just struck once more and Deen is called to revisit the day when his life changed for the worse.</p>
