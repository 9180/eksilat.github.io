        <p>Age: 30</p>
        <p>Gender: Trans Man (He/Him)</p>
        <p>Occupation: Security at Hillington High</p>
        <p>Bio: Deen is one of the two known survivors of the killer known as the "Hazy Days Killer." When he was 6, he witnessed a murder suicide that left him and his sister as orphans. He did not fully acknowledge the deaths of his parents until he turned 16, when remembering his trauma began to seriously conflict with the depression, anxiety and undiagnosed autism and ADHD that he experienced on a daily basis. He was sent to military school for his 11th year, then promptly kicked out and graduated from Hillington High. </p>

        <h2>EGO</h2>
        <img src="images/ego-icon.png">
        <p>Age: Unknown</p>
        <p>Gender: None (He/Him)</p>
        <p>Occupation: The "Hazy Days Killer", None</p>
        <p>Bio: EGO is a shadow demon that has plagued Hillington for years. The mystery of the Hazy Days Killer never really mattered, because the issue was never whodunnit, but how to stop them. Needless to say, EGO has slipped away countless times as a result. His method of action is possessing of the flesh and comitting cannibalistic murder suicides in order to destroy families, as he feeds off the resulting emotional turmoil. EGO is picky about the people that he eats, and being caught in the middle of his act by Deen and Marina when they were young forced him to end his trail of terror quickly and go dormant. He's awoken again now, and it's just a matter of time before he strikes again. </p>

        <p> Bio: Deen's older sister by two years, Marina is a simple woman with simple goals.

She graduated high school at 18 years old, went to college for a teaching degree and returned to Hillington High to work as a counselor. She only cares for the futures of others and would rather not look back on the past. </p>
