		<h5>Stickwork</h5>
		<p class="featuredpost"> Throughout the month, acclaimed artist Patrick Dougherty will be working on the grounds to construct one of his unique, site-specific artworks. Dougherty bends, weaves, and twines twigs and saplings into massive shelters, towers and sculptures, each as unique as the site where it is built. Members-only events, including after-hours tours and conversations with Dougherty are being planned-details coming soon!</p>
