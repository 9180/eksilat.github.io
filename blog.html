		<h5>Branch Out on Arbor Day</h5>
			<h4>November 1, 2019</h4>
		<p class="featuredpost">Most holidays commemorate an event from the past.  Arbor Day, however, focuses on the future.  It celebrates the planting of trees and all the ways trees enrich our lives and improve the environment.  

		The idea for an Arbor Day in the United States originated with Julius Sterling Morton in 1872.  As the editor of Nebraska’s first newspaper, he used that forum to convey his enthusiasm for trees and to advocate for environmental stewardship.  Through his influence, Nebraska designated April 10, 1872, as Arbor Day, the day on which to “plant trees, both forest and fruit.”  By 1885, Arbor Day was named a legal holiday in Nebraska and April 22, Morton’s birthday, was selected as the permanent date.  Shortly after the 1872 observance, other states passed legislation to observe Arbor Day.  Today, most states observe Arbor Day on the last Friday in April, the day designated as National Arbor Day.  

		In Texas, Arbor Day first took place in Temple on February 22, 1889. W. Goodrich Jones initiated a tree planting campaign along the streets of the city. One year later, the first statewide observance of Arbor Day was held in Austin. Through the efforts of Senator George Tyler of Belton, February 22nd was set aside by law as Arbor Day to encourage the planting of trees in this state.

		After the original Texas Arbor Day law expired, the state continued to observe Arbor Day by proclamation of the governor, usually on George Washington’s birthday. In 1949, the state legislature adopted a resolution designating the third Friday in January as Texas Arbor Day. In 1989, however, the legislature passed a resolution moving Texas Arbor Day to the last Friday in April to align with the traditionally observed National Arbor Day.  The problem with this date, though, is that April is not the best time to plant trees in Texas.  Fall is the much better time.  Consequently, in 2013, the Texas legislature established the Texas State Arbor Day as the first Friday in November.  Trees undergo less transplanting shock under the cooler temperatures of fall; furthermore, the tree has all fall and winter to establish its root system in the new planting site before the onslaught of the next summer’s heat.  

		Why plant trees?  They lower the air temperature and offset the “heat island” effect created by so much concrete and asphalt pavement in our cities.  Neighborhoods with mature trees can be up to 11 degrees cooler than neighborhoods without trees. Three mature shade trees placed strategically around a house can reduce air conditioning bills by 10% to 50%. Trees produce oxygen and store carbon dioxide; in fact, a typical tree removes 25-45 pounds of carbon from the air each year.  One acre of trees produces enough oxygen for 18 people every day.  In addition, trees prevent soil erosion and runoff.  They provide food and shelter for wildlife.  They increase property value and improve health and social behavior.  Finally, trees offer beauty to our home and urban settings. 

		The Botanical Research Institute of Texas and the Fort Worth Botanic Garden encourage you to focus on the future by planting one or more trees on November 1, Texas State Arbor Day.</p>

		<h5>PRE Trials at BRIT and FW Botanic Garden</h5>
			<h4>March 14, 2018</h4>
		<p class="featuredpost">Invasive plants are quite the topic of conversation and concern among botanists and horticulturists across the country.  So much so that through a 2017 Farm Bill grant, four botanic gardens across the nation participated in a trial to evaluate a total of 200 plants for their invasiveness.  These gardens used a tool and database called PRE™, which stands for Plant Risk Evaluator.  PRE is a tool for determining a plant’s potential for becoming invasive in any specific region.  BRIT and the Fort Worth Botanic Garden collaborated to evaluate 50 plant species in Texas.   

		Invasive plants are non-native plants that can spread on their own and can cause or are likely to cause environmental and/or economic harm.  A high percentage of invasive plants in the U.S. are of horticultural origin.  Many of these invaders were introduced decades ago as ornamental landscape plants or as plants that served a particular purpose, such as to control erosion, to conserve water, or to grow quickly.  No one could have imagined the costly damage that invasive plants would cause and the threat they would be to native species.  Today we know better because we understand the adverse impacts invasive plants can have on wild lands, waterways, native species, and taxpayers’ wallets.  We also benefit from recent advances in plant screening technology that can predict plant behavior in a given region.  The PRE tool allows for highly accurate (95%) predictions specifically tailored to horticultural plants.  PRE is a 20-question, plant risk assessment tool as well as an online platform and database enabling those involved in non-native, terrestrial plant production to know before they grow if a plant poses a potential regional invasive risk.  Visit the PRE website (<a href="https://pre.ice/ucdavis.edu/">https://pre.ice/ucdavis.edu/</a>) to explore the database already compiled on certain plants. 

		At the Fort Worth Botanic Garden, Zach Gomez collaborated with BRIT by using the PRE tool to predict or to confirm the invasiveness of certain plants within the botanic garden.  He presented his findings at the August 2017 Texas Nursery and Landscape Association convention in Dallas as well as at the annual gathering of the Texas Association of Botanic Gardens and Arboreta (TABGA) in February 2018 in Weatherford.
